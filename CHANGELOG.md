# Changelog

Each release is named **"ORBIT Connectors v<X.Y.Z>"** and contains
per-connector, per-OS installer artifacts following the naming
convention `OrbitConnector-<Host>-Setup-v<Version>.<exe|dmg>`. YAK
files for Rhino keep their McNeel-imposed naming
(`orbit-connector-<v>-rh8-<platform>.yak`) and ship alongside the
canonical artifacts.

The release CI (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) extracts the section
matching the pushed tag (e.g. `## v0.1.1`) and uses it as the GitHub
Release body, so the format of each entry below matters.

## v0.1.1 — Multi-connector release pipeline

- Release naming standardised: each release is now "ORBIT Connectors v<X.Y.Z>"
  containing per-connector, per-OS installers.
- Installer artifact naming: `OrbitConnector-<Host>-Setup-v<Version>.<exe|dmg>`.
- Scaffolded Vectorworks connector — installer build skeleton ships placeholder; plugin source TODO.
- Scaffolded Unreal Engine 5 connector — installer build skeleton ships placeholder; plugin source TODO.
- macOS `.dmg` build path via `hdiutil` for every connector.
- CI: 6 parallel build jobs (Rhino / Vectorworks / UE5 × Windows / macOS)
  feeding a single release job that auto-populates the body from `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Switched `orbit-sdk` clone in CI from PAT-authenticated to tokenless
  (the SDK is now a public repo).

### Caveats

- Vectorworks and UE5 plug-in source is empty — the scaffolded
  installers ship a "coming soon" `README.txt` and nothing else.
- The Rhino macOS YAK build is still gated on splitting the csproj
  into `Core` / `Windows` / `Mac` projects — see
  `installers/rhino/MACOS.md`. The macOS `.dmg` produced by this
  release wraps a "use the YAK package" README rather than a real
  Mac `.pkg`.
- All installers ship **unsigned** — Windows code signing and Apple
  notarisation are parked across every connector for v0.1.x.

## v0.1.0 — Initial public release

- First public ORBIT connector for Rhino 8 (Windows) and Rhino 8 (macOS scaffold).
- Geometry support: Mesh, Brep, Curve, Surface, SubD, Extrusion, PointCloud, Point, Text, Block Instances.
- PBR materials with diffuse / metallic-roughness / emissive / normal textures uploaded as blobs.
- Layer hierarchy with per-object `layerColor` / `layerPath`.
- YAK and Inno Setup installers for Windows.
- macOS YAK scaffold — requires testing on a real Mac before first stable release.

### Installers

- **YAK (Windows, Rhino 8):** `orbit-connector-0.1.0-rh8-win.yak`
  - Recommended distribution. Drop into Rhino via `_PackageManager` or
    install with `yak install <file>.yak` from the command line.
- **Inno Setup (Windows):** `OrbitConnector-Rhino-Setup-v0.1.0.exe`
  - Traditional Windows installer. Per-user install — no admin needed.
- **YAK (macOS):** `orbit-connector-0.1.0-rh8-mac-arm64.yak`,
  `orbit-connector-0.1.0-rh8-mac-x64.yak`
  - Scaffold only — see `installers/rhino/MACOS.md`. Requires a project
    split before it can actually build on macOS CI.

### Release pipeline

- `.github/workflows/release.yml` triggers on tag push `v*`, runs
  `build-windows` + `build-macos`, then publishes a GitHub Release with
  whichever artefacts were produced.
- Installers ship **unsigned** in v0.1.x — code signing is parked, same
  posture as the PRISM agent.
